Introduction
The goal of this project is to detect plant diseases through image recognition. By training a deep learning model using a dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves, the system can classify plant leaves based on their appearance and identify the disease.

Features:
Detects multiple plant diseases.

Provides predictions based on plant leaf images.

Uses deep learning models (CNNs) for image classification.

Project Setup
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/Chando0185/plant_disease_detection.git
cd plant_disease_detection
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

For Windows:

bash
Copy
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies
TensorFlow: A deep learning framework used to build the model.

Keras: High-level API for building neural networks.

NumPy: Package for handling arrays.

Pandas: Library for data manipulation.

Matplotlib: Library for plotting graphs.

OpenCV: Package for image processing.

You can find the full list of dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

Training the Model
Dataset
The model requires a dataset of plant leaf images. Make sure to prepare the dataset and store it in the appropriate directory. You can find various plant disease image datasets online.

Model Training
Prepare your data: Ensure your images are organized in the correct directory structure. Usually, the dataset will be split into subfolders for each class (disease type).

Run the training script:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py
This will start the training process for the model, and once complete, you will have a trained model file that can be used for inference.

Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the diseases of plant leaves.

Run the prediction script:

bash
Copy
python predict.py --image path_to_image
Replace path_to_image with the path to the plant leaf image you want to predict. The model will output the predicted disease label.

You can also integrate the model into any web or desktop application for real-time predictions.
